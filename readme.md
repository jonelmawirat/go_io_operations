### README for MyBuffer Project

# MyBuffer

## Introduction

Welcome to the MyBuffer project! As part of my journey to learn I/O operations in Go, I created a `buffer` struct with `Read` and `Write` methods. This project is designed to help understand the inner workings of byte readers and writers in Go.

## Overview
- The `MyBuffer` struct provides a custom buffer that implements the `io.Reader` and `io.Writer` interfaces.
- It has efficient reading and writing methods to handle data in a byte slice.
- The project includes comprehensive test cases to validate the buffer's functionality.

## Features
- Custom implementation of `Read` and `Write` methods for byte slices.
- Efficient and easy-to-use interface for reading and writing byte data.
- Test suite with edge cases to ensure the buffer's correctness.

## Disclaimer
This README file was created by ChatGPT, but the entire code was written by me.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository.
- Explore the `buffer.go` file for the main implementation.
- Run `go test` to verify the functionality using test cases.

I hope this project helps you as much as it has helped me in understanding Go's I/O operations!
